    "## Project overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will choose a dataset and problem based on your specialization or interests in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  You will decide how you want to solve the problem using the given dataset, then create the code and writeup necessary for others to understand how you solved the problem.  You then have the option of using [Canvas Studio](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Studio/How-do-I-record-a-Canvas-Studio-screen-capture-video-in-a-course/ta-p/1713) to record a video presentation of the problem and your solution, walking through your thought process and code.  If you choose not to make a recording, then you must write your thought process and conclusions in detail within Markdown cells.\n",

    "The project is graded out of 10 points. Points are awarded as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2 points possible for a correct statistical interpretation of the problem\n",
    "    - In other words, make sure you state at the top the type of statistical analysis \n",
    "      you will use to solve the problem and why you chose to perform this type of analysis\n",
    "      given the dataset and the problem description.\n",
    "- 2 points possible for the correct statistical analysis flow implemented based on interpretation\n",
    "    - In other words, make sure that the analytical flow you implement throughout your notebook and \n",
    "      video is consistent with the type of statistical analysis you chose to solve the problem.\n",
    "- 2 points possible for clear Python code logic and intention\n",
    "    - In other words, make sure that you utilize Markdown and code cells to explain the steps you are\n",
    "      taking with code that is written.  For example, if you have a code cell that adds a new column\n",
    "      to a DataFrame (such as when using dummy variables), make sure you explain why you are adding\n",
    "      this new column.\n",
    "- 2 points possible for clear, readable Python code organization\n",
    "    - In other words, if you have any code that needs to be repeated, try to create functions rather\n",
    "      than copy/pasting the same code multiple times. Your code does not need to be perfect, but it \n",
    "      should be readable and easily followed. If you create a function, make sure to include the\n",
    "      function header so that others can understand the purpose and parameters/returns of your function.\n",
    "- 2 point possible for the audio-video presentation or detailed Markdown text explanations\n",
    "    - In other words, if you do not want to record a video explanation, then you must have your\n",
    "      statistical analysis and corresponding Python code well-explained on paper.\n",
    "      \n",
    "If any academic dishonesty is found (any similarities between submitted work or work posted on the Internet that are unexplained), you will receive zero points on this assignment, fail the course, and be referred to the academic dishonesty office, which may result in grounds for dismissal from the MSEE program at Cal State LA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, do your own work, make sure any analyses you run are justified in explanation either in writing or on the video, and do not work with others for this assignment."
